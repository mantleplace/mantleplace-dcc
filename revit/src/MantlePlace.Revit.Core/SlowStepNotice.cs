/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Two steps dominate a site import, and both pay their cost inside a single
/// <c>Transaction.Commit()</c>, in Revit's own <c>updateElementRelations</c>: the site-boundary
/// subdivisions and the imagery drape's retype of the terrain. Measured on one order — an
/// 80,372-point toposolid with 17 land-use rings — that is 610.6 s and 409.1 s on a first import,
/// 247.1 s and 249.6 s on a re-import, with Revit reporting "not responding" for the whole of each.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The drape's half is now paid only on ground that is not already on the imagery type — an
/// earlier import's, or this run's when the terrain step could not prepare that type. A terrain
/// built for a planned drape is otherwise created on it (<see cref="ImportStep.ToposolidType"/>),
/// so its drape has no retype to announce and the shim hands over zero work.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⛔ <b>Nothing here makes the import faster, and that is the decision, not an omission.</b> The
/// alternatives were weighed and refused: <c>Toposolid.Simplify</c> is decimation and the terrain is
/// already too coarse to read as terrain, so it makes the worse defect worse to soften the lesser
/// one; sampling fewer points is the same trade in a different wrapper and has never been measured;
/// and skipping the boundaries addresses at most half the cost while putting the first
/// non-data-driven toggle into <see cref="BundleImportPlanner"/>. What was actually wrong was that a
/// ten-minute freeze arrived with no warning and read as a crash. So it is announced instead.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⛔ <b>What cannot be shown is the inside of one commit.</b> This used to say that a progress bar
/// was not available at all, and that was the decision: the whole import ran in one call on Revit's
/// thread, so nothing could repaint until it returned. That is reversed — the import is staged
/// (<see cref="StagedImport"/>), one step or one chunk per <c>ExternalEvent</c> raise, so the import
/// window moves between steps and between chunks and Cancel is honoured at each boundary. What is
/// still dark is a single <c>Transaction.Commit()</c>: it cannot yield, report part of itself, or be
/// interrupted, and both of these steps spend their whole cost inside one. So the line before it is
/// still the only line there will be <em>for that step</em>, and it says exactly that much.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is text, so it lives where text can be asserted. The shim decides nothing: it hands over the
